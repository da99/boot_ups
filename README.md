BOOT_UPS
========

Various files to help bootstrap. This is higly customized
for my needs so it's highly unlikely that anyone else will
find ALL of it useful.

Some parts of this project may be useful.

It assumes you are using the latest stable release of Ubuntu.

Older versions are left in for archive purposes.


Usage
=====


``` sh

# cd into the dir where you want to install stuff
# /apps is just an example. Change it to whatever
# you want.

cd /apps
git clone https://github.com/da99/boot_ups.git

cd boot_ups
bin/install_luajit_2_0

# do other magical stuff

```
